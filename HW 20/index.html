      <h3 class="heading-4">My Role</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-3">Research for this project was split between myself and a partner, which concluded with the creation of a user persona. From this point we split and each created travel-solutions for our persona. </p>

    <div class="div-block-4">
      <h3 class="heading-4">Research</h3>

          <p class="paragraph-7">“I personally believe your focus is to go outside , so I spend less money on lodging. Just enough to where I know the lodging is going to be clean and nice. If your main aim is to relax , you can spend more money on the hotel.” ~ Rahul, 33</p>

      <p class="paragraph-8">The creation of an empathy map and user persona were used to help us empathize with the information that was collected during research. The primary goal here is the humanization of our collection of data. Interview and survey answers are turned into statements represented thoughts, feeling and actions and then into a relatable persona that represents the collection of our data points.</p><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-6.59.03-PM.png" loading="lazy" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-6.59.03-PM.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-6.59.03-PM.png 800w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-6.59.03-PM.png 955w" sizes="40vw" alt="" class="image-5">

      <h3 class="heading-4">Solution</h3>
      <h4 class="heading-5">User Insight</h4>
      <p class="paragraph-9">People need help prioritizing and organizing travel expenses so that their travel experiences may be more meaningful.</p>
      <h4 class="heading-5">Problem Statement</h4>
      <p class="paragraph-9">Travel&#x27;s struggle to use their money on what is most valuable to them. Therefore, an application is needed that prioritizes budgeting that matches experience preferences.</p>
      <h4 class="heading-5">Value Statement</h4>
      <p class="paragraph-9">Customize, prioritize and get the most out of your trip.</p><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.27.23-PM.png" loading="lazy" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.27.23-PM.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.27.23-PM.png 800w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.27.23-PM.png 1080w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.27.23-PM.png 1166w" sizes="(max-width: 2915px) 40vw, 1166px" alt="" class="image-6">
      <h4 class="heading-6">Journey Mapping</h4>
      <p class="paragraph-15">Two user pathways were created in a journey map. I felt that it would be important that this application could offer conventional booking accommodations as well as its key feature.</p>
      <h4 class="heading-6">Curated Trip Pathways</h4>
      <p class="paragraph-14">The bespoke feature the ShoeString platform is the allowance of prioritizing spending allowances configured by importance to the trip&#x27;s function and the user&#x27;s personal preferences. For example if dining is really important to a user, but lodging is less so they can set the configuration to balance their spending and list good options for both. </p>
      <ol role="list" class="list">
        <li class="list-item-5">User inputs budget range for trip</li>
        <li>User selects leisure, dining, and lodging preferences</li>
        <li>User completes questionnaire for budget prioritization</li>
        <li>User selects from suggested accommodation and activities that match inputed preferences</li>
        <li>User can see remaining budget and how the budget split matches prioritization throughout the entire process</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="heading-4">Concept Testing</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-13">Next I create a low-fidelity prototype so that the concept could be tested.</p><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.41.53-PM.png" loading="lazy" width="637" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.41.53-PM.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.41.53-PM.png 664w" sizes="40vw" alt="" class="image-3"><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.43.50-PM.png" loading="lazy" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.43.50-PM.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.43.50-PM.png 615w" sizes="40vw" alt="">
      <p class="paragraph-10">The main objective of guerrilla testing was to determine if users understood the core concept of the application, could intuitively navigate their way through the user-flows and to discover areas of confusion and error.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="div-block-4">
      <h3 class="heading-4">Iteration</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-12">After conducting guerrilla testing i analyzed the user feedback into a prioritization matrix. This allowed me to clearly decide which would be iterated upon.</p><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.50.45-PM.png" loading="lazy" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.50.45-PM.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.50.45-PM.png 800w, images/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-7.50.45-PM.png 929w" sizes="40vw" alt="" class="image-7">

            <ol role="list">
              <li class="list-item-4">Throughout the curating process users can now see and track their overall budget use from screen to screen. This enables the ability to track while browsing listing or adjusting priorities.</li>
              <li class="list-item-3">Sliders were added to replace dollar sign menus for prioritizing budgets. Users can now see their total percentage or dollar amount changer per allotted item.</li>

    </div>
    <div class="div-block-4">
      <h3 class="heading-4">Summary</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-11">ShoeString gives travelers what they need to prioritize their budget so that it matches what matters most to them. <br><br>Future iterations would emphasize the creation of a user review system that rates experience compared to expectation of the parameter settings. This would allow users to have extra reassurance in trusting ShoeString&#x27;s fundamental process.</p>
